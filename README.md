<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonalvarezz/evm-smart-contract-example/main/assets/screenshot.png" width="500"></p>

This is a web application to interact with the two following smart contracts on the Sepolia (ETH) network:

- [Bank contract 0x37C...6408](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x37C3E0343b0c5E23913eB3f4c346FAF336bf6408)
- [BankToken contract 0x9aF...615e](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9aF18838611950953823154a04a14d2A34eE615e)

The app allows users to deposit and withdraw BankToken(TTK) tokens to and from the Bank Contract.

## üìù Notes

### Motivation

- Gain familiarity interacting with EVM Smart Contract from a web app.

### TODO

- [ ] ops: deploy the app to the internet.
- [ ] docs: add a demo video in the readme
- [x] feat: check allowance
- [ ] feat: support withdrawal
- [ ] feat: support token allowance increase from the app
- [ ] feat: support token minting
- [ ] tech-debt: handle network missmatch. request connecting to sepolia on wallet connection `wallet_switchEthereumChain`
- [ ] feat: maybe more wallets. use ConnectKit, Rainbow or similar
- [ ] feat: Support ENS. Display ENS instead of address, if any.
- [ ] feat: asynchronous transaction status. Allow users to close the app and come later to check the status of their last transaction(s).
- [ ] tech-debt: remove token hardcoded decimals and token name. get its metadata from chain.

### Things I struggled the most with

- Writing into contracts from the app was not working. No matter the contract, the net or the libraries. I tried several combinations and it wouldn't work. As if the call never reached the wallet for signing and transport. I then realized my VPN connection was somehow blocking it. It took me a couple of hours to find out.
